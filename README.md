# Exercism Metadata

A lot of the exercises on Exercism.io have been ported to multiple languages.
As time passes, more edge cases get added to some languages but not others.

This project aims to keep a canonical source of the test inputs and expectations so that
test suites can be generated for each separate language. This may end up being impractical.

See the `exercises/` directory for the metadata.
