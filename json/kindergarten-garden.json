{"name":"kindergarten-garden","blurb":"Write a program that, given a diagram, can tell you which plants each child in the kindergarten class is responsible for.","description":"The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teachers thought it would be a good idea to give them actual seeds, plant them in actual dirt, and grow actual plants.\n\nThey've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.\n\nTo this end, they've put little styrofoam cups along the window sills, and\nplanted one type of plant in each cup, choosing randomly from the available\ntypes of seeds.\n\n```plain\n[window][window][window]\n........................ # each dot represents a styrofoam cup\n........................\n```\n\nThere are 12 children in the class:\n\n- Alice, Bob, Charlie, David,\n- Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet,\n- Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.\n\nEach child gets 4 cups, two on each row. The children are assigned to cups in alphabetical order.\n\nThe following diagram represents Alice's plants:\n\n```plain\n[window][window][window]\nVR......................\nRG......................\n```\n\nSo in the row nearest the window, she has a violet and a radish; in the row behind that, she has a radish and some grass.\n\nYour program will be given the plants from left-to-right starting with the row\nnearest the windows. From this, it should be able to determine which plants belong to which students.\n\nFor example, if it's told that the garden looks like so:\n\n```plain\n[window][window][window]\nVRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\n```\n\nThen if asked for Alice's plants, it should provide:\n\n- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes\n\nWhile asking for Bob's plants would yield:\n\n- Clover, grass, clover, clover\n","source":"Random musings during airplane trip.","source_url":"http://jumpstartlab.com","expectations":[]}
