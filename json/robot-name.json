{"name":"robot-name","blurb":"Write a program that manages robot factory settings.","description":"When robots come off the factory floor, they have no name.\n\nThe first time you boot them up, a random name is generated, such as RX837 or BC811.\n\nEvery once in a while we need to reset a robot to its factory settings, which means that their name gets wiped. The next time you ask, it gets a new name.\n\n\n## For bonus points\n\nDid you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these are some additional things you could try:\n\n* Random names means a risk of collisions. Make sure the same name is never used twice. Feel free to introduce additional tests.\n\nThen please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?\n","source":"A debugging session with Paul Blackwell at gSchool.","source_url":"http://gschool.it","expectations":[]}
