{"name":"saddle-points","blurb":"Write a program that detects saddle points in a matrix.","description":"So say you have a matrix like so:\n\n```plain\n    0  1  2\n  |---------\n0 | 9  8  7\n1 | 5  3  2     \u003c--- saddle point at (1,0)\n2 | 6  6  7\n```\n\nIt has a saddle point at (1, 0).\n\nIt's called a \"saddle point\" because it is greater than or equal to every\nelement in its row and the less than or equal to every element in its column.\n\nA matrix may have zero or more saddle points.\n\nYour code should be able to provide the (possibly empty) list of all the\nsaddle points for any given matrix.\n\nNote that you may find other definitions of matrix saddle points online, but\nthe tests for this exercise follow the above unambiguous definition.\n","source":"J Dalbey's Programming Practice problems","source_url":"http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html","expectations":[]}
