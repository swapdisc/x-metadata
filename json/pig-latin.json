{"name":"pig-latin","blurb":"Implement a program that translates from English to Pig Latin","description":"Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below) but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.\n\n* **Rule 1**: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an \"ay\" sound to the end of the word.\n* **Rule 2**: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an \"ay\" sound to the end of the word.\n\nThere are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too.\n\nSee \u003chttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin\u003e for more details.\n","source":"The Pig Latin exercise at Test First Teaching by Ultrasaurus","source_url":"https://github.com/ultrasaurus/test-first-teaching/blob/master/learn_ruby/pig_latin/","expectations":[]}
