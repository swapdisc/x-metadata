{"name":"strain","blurb":"Implement the `keep` and `discard` operation on collections. Given a collection and a predicate on the collection's elements, `keep` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is true, while `discard` returns a new collection containing those elements where the predicate is false.","description":"For example, given the collection of numbers:\n\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nAnd the predicate:\n\n- is the number even?\n\nThen your `keep` operation should produce:\n\n- 2, 4\n\nWhile your `discard` operation should produce:\n\n- 1, 3, 5\n\nNote that the union of `keep` and `discard` is all the elements.\n\n## Restrictions\n\nKeep your hands off that filter/reject/whatchamacallit functionality\nprovided by your standard library!\nSolve this one yourself using other basic tools instead.\n","source":"Conversation with James Edward Gray II","source_url":"https://twitter.com/jeg2","expectations":[]}
