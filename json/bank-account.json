{"name":"bank-account","blurb":"Bank accounts can be accessed in different ways at the same time.","description":"A bank account can be accessed in multiple ways. Clients can make deposits and\nwithdrawals using the internet, mobile phones, etc. Shops can charge against the\naccount.\n\nCreate an account that can be accessed from multiple threads/processes\n(terminology depends on your programming language).\n\nThe account only needs to be available when the bank is open, though it may be\navailable at all times. You will get notified when the bank opens and closes.\n\n## Instructions\n\nRun the test file, and fix each of the errors in turn. When you get the first\ntest to pass, go to the first pending or skipped test, and make that pass as\nwell. When all of the tests are passing, feel free to submit.\n\nRemember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a\nsolution that is as readable and expressive as you can make it.\n\nHave fun!\n","source":"","source_url":"","expectations":[]}
