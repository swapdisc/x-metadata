{"name":"sieve","blurb":"Write a program that uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all the primes from 2 up to a given number.","description":"The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple, ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit.\n\nCreate your range, starting at two and ending at the given limit.\n\nThe algorithm consists of repeating the following over and over:\n\n- take the next available unmarked number in your list (it is prime)\n- remove all the multiples of that number (they are not prime)\n\nRepeat until you don't have any possible primes left in your range.\n\nWhen the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that have not been removed are prime.\n","source":"Sieve of Eratosthenes at Wikipedia","source_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes","expectations":[]}
