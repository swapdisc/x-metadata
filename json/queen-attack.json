{"name":"queen-attack","blurb":"Write a program that positions two queens on a chess board and indicates whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.","description":"In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row,\ncolumn, or diagonal.\n\nA chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.\n\nSo if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at (5, 6),\nthen you'd know you've got a set-up like so:\n\n```plain\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O W O O O O\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O B O\nO O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O\n```\n\nYou'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.\nIn this case, that answer would be yes, they can,\nbecause both pieces share a diagonal.\n","source":"J Dalbey's Programming Practice problems","source_url":"http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html","expectations":[]}
