{"name":"nucleotide-count","blurb":"Write a class `DNA` that takes a DNA string and tells us how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.","description":"DNA is represented by an alphabet of the following symbols: 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.\n\nEach symbol represents a nucleotide, which is a fancy name for the particular molecules that happen to make up a large part of DNA.\n\nShortest intro to biochemistry EVAR:\n\n* twigs are to birds nests as\n* nucleotides are to DNA and RNA as\n* amino acids are to proteins as\n* sugar is to starch as\n* oh crap lipids\n\nI'm not going to talk about lipids because they're crazy complex.\n\nSo back to nucleotides.\n\nThere are 5 types of nucleotides. 4 of these occur in DNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, and `T`. 4 occur in RNA: `A`, `C`, `G`, `U`.\n\nThere are no other nucleotides.\n\n","source":"The Calculating DNA Nucleotides_problem at Rosalind","source_url":"http://rosalind.info/problems/dna/","expectations":[]}
