{"name":"luhn","blurb":"Write a program that can take a number and determine whether or not it is valid per the Luhn formula.","description":"The Luhn formula is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers and Canadian Social Insurance Numbers.\n\nThe formula verifies a number against its included check digit, which is usually appended to a partial number to generate the full number. This number must pass the following test:\n\n- Counting from rightmost digit (which is the check digit) and moving left, double the value of every second digit.\n- For any digits that thus become 10 or more, subtract 9 from the result.\n  - 1111 becomes 2121.\n  - 8763 becomes 7733 (from 2×6=12 → 12-9=3 and 2×8=16 → 16-9=7).\n- Add all these digits together.\n  - 1111 becomes 2121 sums as 2+1+2+1 to give a check digit of 6.\n  - 8763 becomes 7733, and 7+7+3+3 is 20.\n\nIf the total ends in 0 (put another way, if the total modulus 10 is congruent to 0), then the number is valid according to the Luhn formula; else it is not valid. So, 1111 is not valid (as shown above, it comes out to 6), while 8763 is valid (as shown above, it comes out to 20).\n\nWrite a program that, given a number\n\n- Can check if it is valid per the Luhn formula.\n  - This should treat, for example, \"2323 2005 7766 3554\" as valid.\n- Can add a check digit to make the number valid per the Luhn formula.\n  - This should give \"2323 2005 7766 3554\" in response to \"2323 2005 7766 355\".\n","source":"The Luhn Algorithm on Wikipedia","source_url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm","expectations":[]}
