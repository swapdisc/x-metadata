So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.\n- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.\n  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.\n  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.\n- 5 does go cleanly into 5.\n- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.\n\nOur successful divisors in that computation\nrepresent the list of prime factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.\n\nYou can check this yourself:\n\n- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5\n- = 4 * 15\n- = 60\n- Success!\n","source":"The Prime Factors Kata by Uncle Bob","source_url":"http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.ThePrimeFactorsKata","expectations":[]}
