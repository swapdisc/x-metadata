{"name":"grade-school","blurb":"Write a small archiving program that stores students' names along with the grade that they are in.","description":"In the end, you should be able to:\n\n- Add a student's name to the roster for a grade\n  - \"Add Jim to grade 2.\"\n  - \"OK.\"\n- Get a list of all students enrolled in a grade\n  - \"Which students are in grade 2?\"\n  - \"We've only got Jim just now.\"\n- Get a sorted list of all students in all grades.\n  Grades should sort as 1, 2, 3, etc.,\n  and students within a grade should be sorted alphabetically by name.\n  - \"Who all is enrolled in school right now?\"\n  - \"Grade 1: Anna, Barb, and Charlie. Grade 2: Alex, Peter, and Zoe. Grade 3â€¦\"\n\nNote that all our students only have one name.\n(It's a small town, what do you want?)\n\n\n## For bonus points\n\nDid you get the tests passing and the code clean? If you want to, these are some additional things you could try:\n\n* If your implementation allows outside code to mutate the school's internal DB directly, see if you can prevent this. Feel free to introduce additional tests.\n\nThen please share your thoughts in a comment on the submission. Did this experiment make the code better? Worse? Did you learn anything from it?\n","source":"A pairing session with Phil Battos at gSchool","source_url":"http://gschool.it","expectations":[]}
