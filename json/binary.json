{"name":"binary","blurb":"Write a program that will convert a binary number, represented as a string (i.e. '101010'), to it's decimal equivalent using first principles","description":"Write a program passing the tests.\n\nYou will be guided to implement binary to decimal conversion.\nGiven a binary input string, your program should be able to produce a decimal\noutput.\n\n## Note\n- Implement the conversion yourself.\n  Do not use something else to perform the conversion for you.\n- Treat invalid input as binary 0.\n\n## About Binary (Base-2)\nDecimal is a base-10 system.\n\nA number 23 in base 10 notation can be understood\nas a linear combination of powers of 10:\n\n- The rightmost digit gets multiplied by 10^0 = 1\n- The next number gets multiplied by 10^1 = 10\n- â€¦\n- The *n*th number gets multiplied by 10^*(n-1)*.\n- All these values are summed.\n\nSo: `23 =\u003e 2*10^1 + 3*10^0 =\u003e 2*10 + 3*1 = 23 base 10`\n\nBinary is similar, but uses powers of 2 rather than powers of 10.\n\nSo: `101 =\u003e 1*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 =\u003e 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1 =\u003e 4 + 1 =\u003e 5 base 10`.\n","source":"All of Computer Science","source_url":"http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binary&a=*C.binary-_*MathWorld-","expectations":[]}
