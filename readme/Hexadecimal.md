# Hexadecimal

Write a program that will convert a hexadecimal number, represented as a string (i.e. "10af8c"), to it's decimal equivalent using first principles (i.e. no, you may not use built-in ruby libraries or gems to accomplish the conversion).

On the web we use hexadecimal to represent colors, i.e. green: 008000, teal: 008080, navy: 000080).

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid hexadecimal as the value 0.
